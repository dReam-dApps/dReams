Knight of Coins

The Knight of Wands reminds us that in order to increase our natural
abundance, we must first become good stewards of our fortune. This can
be done by having a proper plan of what you will do with such
abundance. To tap into the natural flow of this construct and aid in
attracting more of this bounty, we must choose benevolent ways to be
conduits of generosity and service. Rely on your integrity to point you
in the ideal direction in order to maximize your impact.
