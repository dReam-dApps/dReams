The Emperor

As The Fool walks his journey, the pendulum must balance out.
Spending so much time in the exquisiteness of The Divine Feminine
mystery, we come into a lesson or a sort of practice phase, the opposite
side of The Empress, but equivalent in nature. Now we are focused on
growing our potency and power via logic and reason.
The last two Major Arcana were a two-part inhale, and this card
represents the beginning of the exhale. We come down off the
proverbial mountain where we fasted and hid ourselves away in a cave
to get closer to The Divine, and now, we rejoin society reborn with our
new etheric skills we have learned. However, in this phase, we must
forget them just temporarily to capitalize on the Alchemical osmotic
potential, as now we can swing deeper into The Father and Emperor
archetype to align with all the lessons herein. This is a time of
integration of your spiritual skills into action in the mundane world of
commerce and business.
