The Realm

Our beloved Fool has passed through all initiations, lessons and states of
Grace bestowed to The Fool on our journey through the Major Arcana.
You have passed and attained inner mastery. All the Arcana now are
shown as feathers in your cap, and we pause here for a moment of
stillness in celebration of your attainment of mastery.

Illusions are shown clearly, with no fear and through the lens of the
Most High. Rest deeply and firmly knowing that the world is, in fact,
your entire projection and creation to steward. You are standing at the
our master builder wielding his power over the lower earthly realms,
with the sheer force of his mind, abundance manifested. This card
indicates favorable positions, investments, trades, or real estate deals.
Large sums of money in trust funds or inheritance may also be in the
stars. Regardless, open wider to receive your kingdom and be a good
steward with such abundance.
