The Lovers

At first glance, the twin-souled Lovers appear to be walking through the
sea into the sun during an eclipse, signifying the Union of the Light and
the Dark within, but at closer reflection what they are walking into is the
Black sun, or the sun of the first realm: Mercury. This card represents
the moment in our life when we are in total symbiosis with our inner
polarities.

This harmonic resonance is reflected by the grand external fractal,
harmonizing the Beloved within and the Beloved without. In a more
practical sense, it can absolutely symbolize a Divine Union with another,
but it comes with the profound message of The Grand Beloved, fusing
you into an amalgamation of its Love from every angle of your
perception. Youâ€™re being offered this frequency to tap into it now. Do
not reject The One whose heart only beats for your ultimate bliss. Can
you find the Alchemical Union within yourself?
