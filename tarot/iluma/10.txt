The Hermit

Ruled by Virgo, which is also the sign of Lord Hanuman in the Vedas,
you see a Monkey God/Monk levitating with a double halo. The Hermit
may have at one point represented the act of isolating oneself in remote
areas, but in the higher interpretation more applicable to today’s world,
it means an isolation from external influences, or rather, the generic
version of reality we all are given, a symbolic type of isolation that
breeds non-reaction, and fosters the power of thinking for oneself, not
being swayed by external sources.

Seeing that, at this stage in our path, we’ve already realized so much,
symbolized by the double illumination, we simply cannot integrate with
others that well, even from within spiritual communities. The solitude
deepens as we turn to the only satiating thing—that of our own pure
presence and communion with Creator, resting in the bosom of our
awareness.
