Knight of Cups

Your armor stands before you as an obstacle to be overcome. Your own
guard seems impenetrable, but it is merely an illusion, a mirage... itâ€™s
time to drop the guard and drop into your more tender side, giving and
receiving love and truly delighting in the suppleness that vulnerability
begets. The most courageous expression at times is when we allow
ourselves to be most tender. Harness this aspect of the divine masculine;
that of gentleness and compassion as well as sensitivity.
