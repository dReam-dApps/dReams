Queen of Cups

Our Queen of the Sacred waters balances the Nine of Cups in perfect
harmony, but in fact there are ten! This symbolizes Godly union and
emotional harmony and maturity. The tenth cup is not visible, but it is
the grail cup within her. The most feminine of all the Minor Arcana,
this card comes to us as a reminder of divine feminine powers of
juggling both compassion and Truth while maintaining complete control
and balance of our inner emotional state. We see clearly, yet we act
from a place of stability for our internal roots trace back to the beginning
of time rooted in the wisdom of our ancestors.
