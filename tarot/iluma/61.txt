Child of Swords

This card represents returning to the innocence in our thoughts, keeping
them pristine and being impeccable with our words. To have
impeccability with our words, we must command impeccable
thoughts. Adding a touch of wonder and remembering that even though
we are fiercely smart, we didnâ€™t become this way because we believe
ourselves to be omnipotent. We arrived through our childlike innocence
that has allowed us to wonder and learn anew. Forget everything you
think you know, be verily curious and watch the secrets of the world
unfold for you.
