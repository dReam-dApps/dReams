The Unspoken

Originally called “The Card With No Name” in this rendition, you see a
horse beast flying through the night, representing a Nightmare, or a mare
running in the night. We don’t know why this mare is running. Did a
gust of wind scare it, or was it due to its own other worldly connections?

This card represents the first initiation on The Fool’s Journey, and that is
one of The Unknown—the deep subconscious, the unspoken, that which
we cannot see. Alluding to the feminine aspects with both symbolism of
the Moon and 13, we could assume this horse is, in fact, a mare. This
initiation allows us to feel an “external” force working against us; after
many cards of accessing our divine spiritual power, we are now ready to
be initiated deeper into our power by an unknown force. Don’t shy
away from such an experience and shut down the light of your
consciousness. Explore, learn, become curious again. You are being
offered a New Beginning, and it will serve you to tap into beginner’s
mind.
