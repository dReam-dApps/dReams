The Magician

Originally “Le Bateleur” in the Marseilles deck, this is the first proper
lesson and initiation on our journey together. Consider this the base line
programming that we get when we drop into this realm as a baby. Every
brand-new soul comes in with basic programming that is force fed either
through school or media, the generic collective consciousness that
everyone gets sucked into or given when they dawn a meat suit and enter
this life. This card represents learning and mastering all the mundane
third dimensional aspects of existence in the “normal world”.

The Fool has learned to navigate the sea of basic human life, and yet
something feels amiss. This is the stage in which awakening can take
place, the alchemical fires within him stir, he looks out into “reality” to
see that not all is as he’s been told. The search for occult Truth begins to
take shape within himself as he becomes increasingly jaded with the
world view he was given. This is the stage when the seed activates and
attempts to burst out of the confines of the seed husk. The intelligence
of the seed knows something grander is out there but cannot quite
perceive what it is. The confines of this formerly protective shell while
the seed was dormant now feels like a prison to the awakening
consciousness craving to expand beyond it. Deep despair grows as the
juxtaposition begins to become more extreme. This feeling will soon
become a catalyst for growth on his journeys into the dark night of the
soul.
