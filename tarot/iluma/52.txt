Two of Swords

On the path of growing, we often are faced with new information that
conflicts with the past. This card asks you to stretch the confines of your
mind to be able to see and hold two totally conflicting data sets inside
your being. Just for a moment, truly sit with this and see what cognitive
dissonance is teaching you. Can you grow from this and expand in your
beliefs; or is the original thought the one that holds the most
weight? Are you secure enough in the belief to allow it to be
tested? Explore and stay steadfast in your search for Truth.
