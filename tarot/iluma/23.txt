Ace of Cups

A seed that will grow. New beginnings, emotions starting to take form
from the depths of the uncharted territory of the subconscious. There is a
fresh start, emotionally, softening the previous rigid structures of the
mind. A new relationship coming to challenge all previous habits and
tendencies. Much growth is promised should the querent maintain
consciousness regarding the new waters.
