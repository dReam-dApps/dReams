The Fool

The first and last card of the Tarot, this card represents the querent or
you. Well, all of us really. It is a reminder to zoom out dimensionally to
access all the levels of our being. When The Fool makes his way
through the lessons, initiations, tests and victories of the Major Arcana,
he finally reaches his fullest attainment, enlightenment, Nirvana, Mt.

Meru/Agartha, Polaris etc. This comes in the form of Union with the
Grandest Beloved (God). From there, once he has achieved this
mastery, he may choose to forget everything he ever knew and start the
journey at the beginning level to play the Game of Life once again, or he
can maintain his mastery and life in the world while being clearly not of
it. The entire world views him as a fool, either being the master
perceived as mad by the sleeping masses, or a brand-new soul: asleep in
the game, a new fractal of Creator waiting to be programmed. Either
way, he is a fool, carefree and jolly, silly and ravenously mad to the
outside world.

The Fool reminds us to view every soul as a master, no matter how
sleepy or sheepy they may seem, even if they are following mindlessly
in the humdrum of the collective hypnosis, as we may not know what
they have achieved already, and if they have chosen to forget it all and
play again. We must trust people even when they make decisions that we
believe are silly, we must honor each person’s self-possession and
mastery, even when we don’t understand it. This card encourages us to
get a bird’s eye perspective (dimensionally speaking) and to realize not
everyone nor everything is as it seems. Honor the divinity within all.
Embrace the Mystery. We do not yet know all.
