Ten of Coins

Encoded in the traditional card, we see the Kabbalistic tree of life in the
arrangement of the coins, as well as an encode for master number 22,
The Builder. In our card, we see an artistic interpretation of that with
our master builder wielding his power over the lower earthly realms,
abundance manifested. This card indicates favorable positions,
investments, trades or real estate deals. Large sums of money in Trust
Funds or inheritance may also be in the stars. Regardless, open wider to
receive your Kingdom and be a good steward with such abundance.
