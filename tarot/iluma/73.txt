Nine of Coins

You have worked extremely hard and attained a level of success, but at
what cost? The remnants of your memories sharing successes with good
company have cobwebs on them and youâ€™re left here to celebrate all
alone. Reach out and pull in your loved ones and share your wins with
them... life is sweeter in the presence of others.
