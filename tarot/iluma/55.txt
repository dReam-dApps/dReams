Five of Swords

Perhaps weâ€™ve swung too far in our isolation and steadfastness in our
own beliefs and viewpoints. At times and especially following a period
of intense isolation, we may become rigid in our thought patterns. It is
indeed a delicate balance between not allowing lower vibrations into our
field and maintaining our sense of peace. Come back to your heart space
and remember to have compassion for self and others while remaining in
your own steadfast integrity.
