Child of Wands

Delight in the magic around you! Call upon the magic of nature to
inspire new creative ways to move in life. Change your scenery, even if
only from the inside to get a new perspective and seek out all the
magical underlying currents that are here in service to you! If you
cannot find it, create it! Delight in making a sacred space in your home
or an altar in which to activate your own magical side. Entertain a
creative writing practice of your own!
