Ten of Wands

A new beginning of something already in your life. Clear action steps
that can bring new life to a project previously started. Time is cyclical
and just as the sky clock rotates in 360 degrees, so does time. It also
follows either an upward or downward trajectory, depending on your
thoughts. This shows a higher dimensional octave of a previous project
or situation in your life, in a higher timeframe. You are creating a new
beginning. Alignment and ascending progress await as our journey
continues.
