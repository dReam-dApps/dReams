Strength

Here you see a Jaguar Queen, perched at the edge of the Earth, using the
sheer force of her mental faculties to conjure portals and bring to fruition
the musings of her deep subconscious. We cannot make out whether the
beasts coming from the portal of the infinite are friends or foes, yet she
doesn’t waiver, displaying her mental and physical fortitude in her
grounded footing. No matter what’s ahead of her, she is calm and
poised, ready to face whatever it is.

Ready to see what you’re made of? Or what you’re making? Either way,
growth is occurring. Be careful not to force things with your willpower.
You are being called into a higher expression of strength, one more
feminine and allowing, not domineering reality. Instead of over-
working, can you access flow states more?
