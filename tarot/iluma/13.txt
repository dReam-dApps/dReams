The Hanged Man

After fumbling around and trying to create using only sheer force and
overpowering the situation, you finally are ready to “Let Go and Let
God” as shown here in our Hanged Man. He is inverted but illuminated,
showing that he has surrendered to The Divine and is now fully working
in alignment with the pulse of consciousness that is igniting and
connecting us all. This represents an exhale, where we allow and
surrender to what is. We have done all the work, and we are tired of
forcing. Now we surrender deeper into the more subtle Arcanum,
aligning Head and Heart with the will of The Grand Beloved that some
may call God.

This is a time for releasing all attachments and expectations to outcomes
and allowing the ‘Co’ aspect of co-creation manifest its will and flow
through you. Do you trust that you are held by the Grand Beloved? Can
you surrender into God’s will for you? How can you become more
comfortable with the unknown?
