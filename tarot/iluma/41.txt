Five of Wands

Chaos? Look deeper, it is merely the casting of your innermost
thoughts. Have you gotten sloppy in your presence and housekeeping of
your thoughts? Are those subconscious programs of lack, failure, etc.
still programming reality and reflecting conflict and struggle back to you
in your life? Relax. Get centered. Let the light of your consciousness
pierce through the sigils your thoughts have cast, undoing them and
redoing them with the full power of your Soul. Recommended to start a
meditation practice of simple vipassana. Observe your breath.
