Two of Cups

A new union forming~ divine and aligned, an alchemical marriage of
perfect polarities. Resonance between two, usually lovers, but can also
be work or other types of partnerships. Conversely, it can also mean
harmonization of the polarities within oneself. Think of an electrical
circuit of liquid living plasma, flowing from harmonic emotions creating
cosmic connectivity. This is a highly auspicious card.
