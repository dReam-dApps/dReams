The Adversary

We may truly never know the fabric of what we’re made of without a
good Adversary. In this card, traditionally known as The Devil, we see
a powerful figure gazing ominously at us through a mask. We cannot tell
who is truly behind such a mask, yet we assume outwardly that it is not
of self. After all, every good hero needs a powerful Adversary.

The Adversary represents the second initiation in The Fool’s Journey,
where we’re faced with insurmountable obstacles. Whether emotional or
earthly, this situation appears to be concrete and very solid. Upon
further introspection, we see that the adversary came in service to us all
along. And in most cases, the astute journeyer can see how the
adversary and himself are one and the same. Again, call on your inner
alchemical skillset to transmute this situation into fuel for your wildest
dreams. In what ways does the situation at hand serve you? Are you
actually your own worst enemy?
