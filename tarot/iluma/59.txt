Nine of Swords

Locked in your own delusions caused by not gaining control over your
thoughts, you may have strayed too far into self-protection
mode. Illusions are influencing your desire to protect yourself regarding
your future as you may be projecting fears into your future. Good news
is, they are all illusions! Put down your weapon, as the hilt of your
sword is broken. This is revealing that youâ€™ve been cutting your own
hand, for you are your own enemy and self-defense will be futile.
