The Empress

The performance card of the journey, and the first official victory having
passed through the dark night of the soul in the previous cards, The
Empress represents mastery of manifestation, allowing oneself to craft
and birth in life goals with artistry and efficiency. The Empress
represents a time where we are nurturing our spiritual side and
connection to The Divine.

This is our first victory and flow state where miraculous blessings are
being showered over us. Auspicious indeed, and perhaps also a bit
indulgent, but The Divine smiles on her gratitude for each one of the
blessings bestowed. Her faith in co-creation brings The Divine sheer
bliss to watch her radiance in action, creating the way she was made for.
She creates with unbridled abandon, overcoming things never thought
possible, and for a moment, she sits invincible and unrivaled in the
power of the Universe.
