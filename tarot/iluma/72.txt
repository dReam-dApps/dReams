Eight of Coins

This card is full of alchemical sigils and a scrying mirror at the top
reserved exclusively for our own consciousness to peer through. By the
sheer focus of our aligned actions and mind, we have many fruits
materializing into existence. We are in a powerful state here and it has
come from within our own desires and actions birthed from crystal clear
intention.
