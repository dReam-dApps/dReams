Four of Wands

You are shattering a major ceiling you previously were unable to breach
and have achieved a major breakthrough. By watching your thoughts
you can create beyond what you think you are capable of achieving!
Simply by holding the compass of your thoughts steadily pointed due
north in the direction of your highest calling, purpose and desires. Align
your head with your heart and witness your inner- warrior fight the
battles against baseline programs. Victoriously your warrior of presence
will expel any implantations that are not in service to your highest
calling. Stay steady on the course to victory.
