Eight of Swords

There are many choices, many routes, many thoughts, many apparent
obstacles and they all look shiny and beautiful. Perhaps you can see
yourself in nearly all the reflections of each option and they may be
connected. Caught in thought loops, going in circles and confusion
brings a message: itâ€™s time to find the still point within you now. Get off
the merry-go-round of incessant spinning and arrive at Zero Point.
