King of Cups

Our noble King of the calm waters comes to us as a symbol of
diplomacy, calmness and gentleness in conflict and inner or outer
composure. This card offers you a unique vantage point to your
emotions, rising above them and calming the internal waters. We
approach and channel our emotions through the prism of the upward
facing pyramid, referencing the divine masculine, so we are being firm,
yet compassionate. We are navigating our lives in a way that illuminates
both Truth and our deeper emotional intuition.
