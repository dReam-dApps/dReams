The House of God

Whether or not we have successfully passed through the mastery portion
of the previous card, realizing we are, in fact, our own adversary or not,
this card comes to us as a stark re-awakening. Your eyes, and especially
your third eye, can no longer stay closed to the light of Cosmic and
Divine Truth that flows into it at increasing speeds. The river of
information from the superhighway of Nature and God flows into your
crown, and if you attempt to shy away from it, destruction can occur.
Allow this third initiation, however forceful it may feel, to catapult
lower aspects of your ego out so only a solid foundation of authenticity
may stand the test of time.

When penetrated with the light of God, can you allow it to illuminate
your own true nature? Are you clinging to aspects of yourself that are
disingenuous? What are you being called to allow to dissolve and soften
into a more authentic version of yourself?
