Two of Coins

Even in the face of multiple different projects taking life in different
directions, you are doing a fine job at balancing and juggling
them. Multitasking comes with ease and flow as represented by two
distinct coins aligned at their apex, illuminated individually and joined
in perfect balance by your awareness. However, itâ€™s a reminder to not
take on too much, as the balance is delicate. Emphasis is on self-care to
maintain this split focus.
