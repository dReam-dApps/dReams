King of Wands

You have mastered your flow to attain pretty much any goal you set
your sights on. You have learned to use every single one of your
strengths to assist you on the journey, whether it be your charisma or
your brilliance in leadership inspiring others to action. Beware of
arrogance and a quick temper, as a good leader will keep their own
actions in check. Whether this is you or those around you; watch out for
these behaviors.
