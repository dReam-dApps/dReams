Seven of Cups

Your head is in the clouds, but thatâ€™s perfect because your feet are
grounded steadily into reality. You are reflecting on your emotions and
using them as an alchemical fuel to pour into your chalice as you create
the next version of your dream of Heaven on Aerthe. Remember to
breathe, you are continuously stepping into emotional mastery. Can you
have more compassion with yourself?
