Nine of Wands

The harvest of your alchemical garden is upon you. It is wise to refrain
from starting brand new projects. Instead, complete and integrate what
projects you have already begun. There is so much in your garden that
is already ripe and ready for your enjoyment. Celebrate, integrate and
feel satiated with the fruits of your labors. If some loose ends remain,
polish them up and tie things down. Discover what messages are
inscribed along the stones of the path that you took to get to where you
are, decode the hidden messages. There is much more to learn from this
accomplishment.
