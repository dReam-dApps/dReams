Judgment

Immediately following the spontaneous state of grace that was bestowed
on The Fool in the previous card, the weight of his own responsibility
falls on him all at once. Judgment comes swiftly, and “Ayni”, or right
relationship, must proceed. The Fool is offered a final opportunity to
course correct nearly immediately in only such a way that Truth and
Love can guide, for he’s reached the heights of Anointed Illumination
and the internal alchemical marriage, and now it is a sacred duty to make
a judgment on oneself.

With this comes the opportunity for responsibility for our creation. What
will we choose? Will we take the Melchizedek vow and be of service
till every aspect of our creation meets the light of the highest Truth and
willing joins The One? Or will we dissolve into the abyss of unbridled
bliss from whence we came—Waheguru—once more? The choice is ok
whether to stay and be of service or to dissolve back into The Divine.
Only you will know.
