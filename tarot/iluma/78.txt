King of Coins

In the highest expression of divine masculine, you have called forth your
most noble role as protector and provider in this card. The King of
Coins has materialized his place in the heavens! His wealth originated
with an internal inheritance of all the qualities of Earth combined. He
has formed a union with Source which is manifest here as a bounty of
wealth. Be aware you can select other currencies from the heavens to be
paid in as well, that of spiritual clarity and connection to The Divine is
the most valuable currency.
