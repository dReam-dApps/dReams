Three of Cups

A celebration, time to indulge in the highest of blissful and joyful
vibrations amongst community and friends. Possibly a wedding or a
festival, sweeter with a lover by your side. Emotional release and
creativity. Dance and make art! Find one thing you can celebrate about
yourself, your community and your beloved at this very moment. You
are the creator of the bliss that you seek!
