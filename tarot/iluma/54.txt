Four of Swords

Stability and groundedness in our current world view. Thoughts and
ideas are zooming at you from all angles, yet you are grounded in your
own beliefs. Get there and stay there. Go inward, reflect. Cut out all
external noise while being rooted and stable in what is true to
YOU. There are many “wanna-be gurus,” and everyone is vying for
your mental real estate. Be your own developer, find your center and
your Source. Stay firm in your beliefs.
