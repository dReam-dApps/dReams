Two of Wands

This represents two distinct paths you can take, and only that still small
voice inside you knows what the right path may be. Beyond that there is
a more elevated option, where the choice is not between only two paths,
but rather the idea of destiny and the concept of creatorhood. On the one
path, you are a victim to external situations, while on the other, you are
taking responsibility for your thoughts and creations. Should you
choose the latter path, spend sixty seconds right now immersing yourself
in the feeling you get when the situation you desire most comes to
fruition. Rejoice in all the bounteous feelings and manifest destiny.
