Six of Swords

A time of melding and integrating all your conflicting beliefs and
perhaps those of others close to you, into an alchemical
amalgamation. You have softened your sharp edges and are no longer
harming yourself or others with a veiled or conflicted mind. Instead,
they are harmonizing and congealing into becoming an egregore that can
be of service to your dreams. Conversely, this will beget a newfound
security within, at least at an emotional level, by synthesizing the
paradigm.
