Three of Wands

This represents the path of creatorship. Even though you canâ€™t see the
full story, how the magick unfolds or even the magical tips of two of
these wands; you are centered in your creation and ready at the
helm. Symbolizing unity of the paths, the left-hand and the right-hand
path, you find yourself in a place of neutrality, actively creating your
way.
