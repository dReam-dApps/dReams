Three of Swords

A time of testing and outwardly expressing newly integrated beliefs.
Sending out thoughts to the world and discovering what is being
reflected to you. Are you the common denominator for your life’s
affairs? Whether it seems good or bad, the answer is “yes.” If you are
unable to see this, you might be stuck looping in the victim
mentality. The divine is offering you a ray of grace, but to claim its
bounty you must accept accountability for your thoughts and their effect
on creation.
