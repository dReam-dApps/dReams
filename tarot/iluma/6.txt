The Hierophant

Originally called Le Pope in the Tarot de Marseilles, this card
symbolizes the integrations of both lower-level Masculine/Feminine and
the higher levels as well. We’ve integrated our mundane skills in both
polarities with the spiritual skills for both masculine and feminine
aspects of self.
This is the perfect balance and harmony of all the skills in the Major
Arcana up to this point, yet this card is slightly more masculine in
nature. The Hierophant is the embodiment of a spiritually awakened
man. Think of all the juicy qualities of an alpha male but tempered
through a lens of the wolf who leads the pack from the rear of the pack,
not out of fear and haste, but out of a harmonious respect that can only
come from authentic connection to Source. Things are easy, gentle and
powerful in the river of life. Careful of remaining here for too long—it is
easy to get caught in this phase and lose the natural balance of
Alchemical polarity. Continue the journey of The Fool to avoid
stagnancy.
