Seven of Coins

If there is a card that represents no action in this tarot, this is it. Do not
trade, do not make investments, do not rework your business model, just
take a breath and wait and see, for everything is up in the air! You need
to honor the exhale of this situation and just let go. Rest, self-care, focus
on anything but the thing in question, itâ€™s too early to tell.
