Ten of Cups

Cosmic Union, transcendental consciousness that comes from either a
Divine Union in the external in the form of a beloved, or from within, as
in the cosmic alchemical marriage between the physical and
etheric. You are vibrating and rippling out waves of radiant harmonic
energy as a result of this attainment, giving healing and blessings to all
who drink from your vibrational chalice full of Love. Be Bliss!!! You
have attained it!
