Temperance

Having been a bit too careless, we may have found ourselves allowing
some laziness and darkness into our thoughts in the previous Arcana.
Here is where we deepen our internal alchemical practice and learn to
temper our emotional responses, yet again. We have accessed a deeper
layer of our mental facilities, one such layer that most do not ever get to
even perceive. The currents are very subtle and move ever so slightly on
the inner pendulum of emotion, yet at our current state of self-mastery,
they cause potentially large swings in our external reality that reflects to
us.

As the alchemist grows, they must create spagyrics that are more and
more refined as ‘less is more’ truly prevails in these settings. How can
you find the middle path where you can distill the essence of your
emotions to an even more refined decoction? Can you ease into a middle
path and yet access just as much joy in the simple satisfactions?
