The Chariot

After reaching the euphoric heights of The Lovers, we now come back
down to Earth a bit and begin to manifest action. This card represents
victories and boundaries. Boundaries could be in the mundane sense of
exerting firm boundaries to ensure your success as well as exploring the
mystery of where your boundaries end and those of The Divine begin.
This card has subtle references to card X (The Wheel of Fortune), with
both the X in the image and the wheel as we begin to create momentum
in our manifestations—the discovery between our impacts on creation
and destiny continues.

Are we indeed creating everything around us if the Grand Beloved has
united with our very essence, or are we simply experiencing Karma, or
Destiny? The horse-like entities are a synthesis of both the light
(consciousness) and the dark (unconscious) within us, which is used as a
catalyst to our goals, propelling us through equal parts unresolved ego
and trauma and the taste of Divine Union, Waheguru, that came to us in
card 6.

Yet the quest must go on. Can you pinpoint the boundary where you end
and Creator’s creation begins? Or are you going to crawl back in your
shell, overwhelmed by the illusion of “other”, and protect yourself in the
dark unconscious and the unformed?
