Three of Coins

Cultivate your creative side to add some extra fire and momentum to
your business. Brainstorm creative, out-of-the-box ways to improve and
innovate. Consult your network, perhaps friends and family, or even
hire a third party to help or strategize new ways that can exalt your
endeavors. If you are not involved in business, this pertains to your
living situation, perhaps rearranging your furniture according to Feng
Shui or something equally creative.
