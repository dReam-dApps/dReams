The High Priestess

The dark night of the soul commences, a journey into the watery world
of illusion and discovery of Truth, but herein also, a glimmer of hope
buds as we become more in tune and aware of our spiritual nature as
symbolized by the lotus. We begin to learn and discover the power of
our soul’s hidden wisdom that whispers to us only in the stillness of the
mind and a calm beating heart. The Search expands into Seeking, in the
dark, like the seedling that has finally broken through the seed husk and
must now navigate its way through the moist, dark layers of soil to get to
the sun. The Fool begins to experiment from the inside with their direct
effects on this sacred construct we call reality.

What are the boundaries where The Fool ends and the external ‘reality’
begins? What effects can be created? What is Truth? What is no longer
serving our identity of self? The Fool integrates the cognitive
dissonance and masterfully dispels all that no longer stands on its own.
