Child of Cups

Return to the inner magick of curiosity and invoke a childlike
wonder. Look into your emotional instincts with the intention to
discover from the eyes of a child. What can you learn about this
situation and how can you understand your emotions even more deeply?
From this new understanding about what makes you tick, can you tap
into the magick of pure emotion to create something that exceeds your
previous ceiling or cap of creative potential?
