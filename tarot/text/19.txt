The Moon

The final initiation on the journey of The Fool: we stare at a faceless
Moon Goddess on a floating island. We cannot tell if it’s an illusion or if
it is, in fact, a being of this realm. The confusion leads us to reflect over
our entire journey thus far. Has this construct we exist in, that protects
us, and holds the soft insides of our existence even real? Or is everything
an illusion—have we been in some sweet, timeless dream all along, or
do the events that took place within this construct have their own
tangible meaning?

We are taken back to the primordial shores of our own emotions; can we
read the currents of Truth in the waters within? What lessons does the
construct offer us from each perspective? What can we learn from this
current situation under both pretense of false and real? What would it
mean if this situation was how you perceive it? Could it be another
way? What role do you play in the assessment of its validity?
