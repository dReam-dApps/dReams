The Star

Bravo! You have finally allowed the previous initiations to soften you,
leaving only the supple undercurrents of your pure heart. Here you sit,
in the fullness of both your expression and innocence. Take a moment
to congratulate yourself and offer yourself the sweetest embrace of self-
love, for not all who take the path of The Fool attain such sweet heights
as to have landed at The Star. From this state of purity, you are born
anew, and thus have the capacity to tap into new and unique solutions
knowing you have already walked into the fires and have become not
only the Alchemist but the alchemy itself.

It’s all within you at this point—indulge here in the suppleness of a clear
North Star and inner gnosis. This is a card to celebrate your true nature.
What things can you acknowledge and celebrate about yourself right
now? How can you honor this delicate aspect of your own innocence
more?
