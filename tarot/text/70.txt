Six of Coins

You have found yourself in a time of benevolence and charity that has
come from building your own fortress first. You are safe and secure and
now you can express your generosity in ways that allow you to continue
to maintain the balance of meeting your needs and the desire to
give. Beware that if you allow this behavior to take away the
protections and safety that you have in place for yourself, you will no
longer be in balance and alignment with this bounteousness.
