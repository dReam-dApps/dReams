Seven of Wands

At first glance, the odds seem stacked against you, the obstacles
insurmountable as you begin the treacherous ascent up the post. Do not
waiver. This is a test where you discover what you're made of... What is
the boundary of where my creation ends, and destiny begins? Will you
attain the jewel which resides in the consciousness of the Most High?
The choice is yours, but do not forget to zoom out and put it in
perspective of how close you are. You have already climbed to the
heights of insurmountable obstacles. Donâ€™t give up now, you are so
close.
