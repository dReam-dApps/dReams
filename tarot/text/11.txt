Wheel of Fortune

We are reaping the rewards of our labors, and just as this wheel
represents movement, and particularly movement with favorable
connotations as influenced by Jupiter, we see the remnants of a Zodiac
wheel. However, it is not the one we know of today. It is an ancient one,
perhaps from distant pasts, where we have met ourselves in the same
orientation on the wheel, but from either higher or lower on the cosmic
horizon. This symbolizes cycles and favorable karmic implications, but
each time we pass through it, we are reminded by the foreign zodiac of
lessons and distant memories of times past.

We have an opportunity at this junction to unite with all aspects of our
soul and wisdom from ancient lifetimes. This is a moment in the
journey that seems timeless, connecting both ancient past with future
times. Access this wisdom through a courageous heart, where living
liquid plasma may be vortexed faster than the speed of light. The Divine
lives in this sacred moment out of time.
