The Sun

The twins stand so close, yet they are totally separated in different
realms or dimensions. They are, however, also staring at seemingly the
same Sun. The ultimate symbol for ‘As Above, So Below’, these two
children do know of their connection, as they are still caught in duality,
but with the light of their focus and attention, they are setting themselves
on a course to transcend it. The small thin firmament that separates the
two children is becoming thinner and thinner as the light of the Sun
grows.

And just like that, we too dissolve into Unity when the light of our
awareness grows. Simultaneously, the Black Sun which represents our
inner awareness rises and supersedes all external false idols, and we
soon come to be consumed by the all-pervading force of this Clear Light
of the Void. A moment of peace engulfs us as we still the two minds
and bring them into the harmonic resonance of unity.
