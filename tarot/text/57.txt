Seven of Swords

After a period of activity, you may be feeling stuck or like momentum is
stagnant. If this is the case, this card comes to you with a message of rest
and surrender. If the path to your desired destination is not opening and
aligning with ease at this moment, just relax and allow it to be as it
is. Focus on the destination but let go of the idea that you had regarding
the details and the route you thought youâ€™d take to get there. Obstacles
are a blessing in disguise.
