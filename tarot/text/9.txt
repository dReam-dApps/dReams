Justice

This is the stage in the journey where we are operating in perfect
balance; our manifestations are falling at our feet nearly faster than we
can adjust to. So we taper back and begin to explore the morality of
desire and creation. We get in touch with the deeper values that can
only be pondered when we have attained the mastery of all the cards that
have come before this one. We study the morality between our choices
and our desires, and perhaps decide that though we wield massive
power, we refrain from using it as we desire to return to a simpler trickle
of life. We don the helmet of a light warrior, connected directly to
Source, yet stay in utter peace and balance through non-action,
becoming stewards of this immense power, but disciplined like a highly
trained Shaolin Monk, being careful not to use it out of alignment with
our highest integrity in order to maintain the delicate balance of the
scales of nature.
